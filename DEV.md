## Development

Goals:
* become spring-boot-1.2.3 compatible (achieved)
* automated test-sequence (no need to start manually the application)
* update to use maven dependency-management (same versions)
* update versions to come closer to spring-platform-1.2.0
* finally: use spring-platform-bom-1.2.0 for maven dependency-management
